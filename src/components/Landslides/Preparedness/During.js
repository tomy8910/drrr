            When indoors in a landslide area and there is no time to evacuate,
            stay inside and hide under a sturdy and stable object like a table.

          <li>
            When caught outdoors:
            <ul>
              <li>Stay away from the path of the landslide.</li>
              <li>Go to the nearest higher ground away from the landslide.</li>
              <li>
                Run towards the direction of the back of trees or buildings when
                you see approaching rocks and soil debris.
              </li>
              <li>
                If it seems impossible to avoid the landslide, assume a fetal
                position and cover your head.
