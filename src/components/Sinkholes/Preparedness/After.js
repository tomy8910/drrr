            If the hole is large, the volume of material needed to fill it may
            be too great or additional materials such as concrete and large rock
            may be required.
          </li>
          <li>Contact an experienced individual to assist you.</li>
          <li>
            Try to divert any extra water away from a hole before, during and
            after filling.

          <li>
            Use qualified, reliable individuals or companies for repair. Filling
            a sinkhole with waste materials is illegal and may cause groundwater
            contamination for which the property owner would be liable.
