        <h2>Understanding Sinkholes</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Sinkholes</strong> are geologic formation caused by exposure
          to the water, erosion, and ground movement. A sinkhole is usually
          formed by erosion of bedrocks composed of soft minerals and rocks such
          as salt, gypsum, limestone, dolomite, and other materials that belong
          to the evaporate or carbonate classes of rocks. Acidic water
          underground and rainwater dissolve the rocks and form underground
          passages called <strong>conduits</strong>. The conduits help develop
          underground basins known as recharge areas, which in turn contribute
          to the formation of sinkholes as water flowing to and from them erodes
          the bedrock. Sinkholes can also be formed due to the lack of water
          that suppoerts thin earth surface.

        <p>
          The principle in the formation of a sinkhole is similar to the
          formation of caves and underground rivers. The sea water dissolves the
          bedrock and creates the caves. When there is an earthquake, the ground
          above can collapse causing a sinkhole. The ground shaking during
          earthquake can cause the consolidation of the soil particles in
          coastal areas.
